# Solve Data Structures and Algorithms Problems in Python
This is a repository containing solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems that are commonly used in technical interviews and competitive programming. The solutions are written in Python and are organized by problem category, with each problem having its own Python file.

The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for individuals who are interested in improving their problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews. By reviewing and implementing the solutions in this repository, individuals can become more familiar with common data structures and algorithms and develop their coding abilities.

In this repository, you will find solutions to problems such as:

## algorithms:
- [**Sorting Algorithms**](Sorting/) (Quicksort, Merge Sort, Heapsort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
-	Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc.)
-	Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, Topological Sort, Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms, etc.)
-	Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, etc.)
-	String Algorithms (KMP Algorithm, Rabin-Karp Algorithm, Suffix Trees, etc.)
-	Divide and Conquer Algorithms (Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
-	Backtracking Algorithms (N-Queens, Sudoku, etc.)
-	Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection Problem, Huffman Coding, etc.)
-	Numerical Algorithms (Euclidean Algorithm, Modular Arithmetic, Fast Fourier Transform, etc.)
-	Randomized Algorithms (QuickSelect, Quicksort with Randomized Partition, etc.)
## data structures:
-	Arrays
-	Linked Lists
-	Stacks
-	Queues
-	Trees (Binary, AVL, Red-Black, B-trees, etc.)
-	Hash Tables
-	Graphs
-	Heaps (Min/Max Heap, Binomial Heap, Fibonacci Heap, etc.)
-	Trie
-	Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
-	Segment Tree
-	Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
-	Skip List
-	Bloom Filter
-	Priority Queue
## Solve problems
[**Leetcode folder**](Leetcode-Problems/) contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. I solve a new problem always and add the solution code to this repository.

<br><br>

Each Python file contains a solution to a specific problem, along with comments explaining the thought process and approach used to solve the problem. The solutions are designed to be readable, efficient, and well-organized, with clear variable names and comments.

Feel free to use and modify the code in this repository as you see fit. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for new problems to include, please feel free to reach out and contribute to the repository.
