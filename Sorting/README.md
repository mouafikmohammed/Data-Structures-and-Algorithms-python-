## Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm
Sorting is the process of arranging items in a specific order. In computer science, sorting is a fundamental operation that involves reordering elements in a collection, such as an array, in a specific way. Sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a collection in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order.
